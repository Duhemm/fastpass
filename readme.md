# Fastpass

Fastpass is an experimental and unsupported command-line tool to export
[Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) builds to
[Bloop](https://scalacenter.github.io/bloop/).

## Installation

There are no installation instructions for this project since it's still
evolving and it's not clear what the exact setup requirements are (Pants
version, Pants plugins). 

If you are trying to use Fastpass with Pants for IntelliJ,  we recommend using
the Pants IntelliJ Plugin instead
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7412-pants-support/versions

If you are trying to use Pants with VS Code, Vim, Emacs or another LSP editor,
please open a feature request at https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/
